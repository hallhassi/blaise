text4: A fairly straightforward "aimless young smart people" graphic novella in the vein of Adrian Tomine or Ghost World-era Dan Clowes, drawn in the wispy, dreamlike style of C.F
text1: Once in a while a lot of attention will be paid to someone’s hair or another detail and it will be completely shaded
text3: It is difficult to separate Larmee’s theories from his actual work, so all I can do is take both at face value
text5: Young Lions is a somewhat controversial book (which we're always happy to see) around the Atomic offices
text2: It is also, most obviously, the work of a young man (born in 1985) trying to understand the mythologies he’s interpreted for himself
text6: Un truc complètement mystique, un style retro, très plaisant même si on comprend pas tout
text7: Reading Young Lions is like clapping to keep Tinkerbell alive
